vimium-dvorak
=============

Custom vimium keybinding for the dvorak and йцукен layouts
Most keybindings left as default except for "j","k","h","t" and "l". 
The alterations were made for the purpose of optimizing scroll keys placement on a keyboard.

Additionaly there are matching keybinding of the russian letters.

To use copy the content of the file keymapping.txt into the Vimium "Custom key
mappings" textbox.
